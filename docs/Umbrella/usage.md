# Usage
## Setup

To run an umbrella calculation, you need two key files: 

* `Parameter file` (default = complex.parm7) Can be changed using `pyBrella --ParmFile PARM`
* `Coordinate file` (default = start.rst7) Can be changed using `pyBrella --StartFile COORD`


These two files, along with other user defined [variables](#UserInputs) are all you need in order to perform Umbrella Sampling.
